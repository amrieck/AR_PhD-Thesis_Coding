A) Prediction with already existing models

0) File structure

Before using this code either change the designated lines for file localization or adhere to following file structure.

Working Directory

	/Image 1/Image1.tiff
	/Image 2/Image2.tiff
	...
	
	/models/model-name/stardistmodel.json
					  /weights_best.h5
					  ...
	
	
	Stardist-LD-Prediction.ipypnb
	CSV-sorter.ipypnb
	
1) Decompress tiff files

Some propritary image formats like .lif need to export the images to .tif format.
However, they do so in a form that is compressed. This compression creates errors with the 
stardist package. My workaraound for this is to simply open and resave the image using a fiji macro.

Run the fiji decompression macro on the working directory.

2) Run the Stardist-LD-Prediction
